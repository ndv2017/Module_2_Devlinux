# Advanced C/C++ and System Design - Module 2 Devlinux

This module focuses on strengthening core knowledge in advanced C/C++ programming, system design, and software engineering best practices.

## Repository Structure

### [01__Clean_Code](01__Clean_Code/BT1/)
Practices Clean Code principles and C coding conventions through a Library Management System project.

### [02__Design_Pattern](02__Design_Pattern/)
Applies fundamental software design patterns to embedded C projects.

#### Creational
- **[BT1_Singleton](02__Design_Pattern/Creational/BT1_Singleton/)**: Ensures a single instance of a `sensor_manager` for centralized sensor data handling.
- **[BT2_Factory](02__Design_Pattern/Creational/BT2_Factory/)**: Implements a flexible sensor interface using the Factory Pattern for open/closed system design.
- **[BT3_Builder](02__Design_Pattern/Creational/BT3_Builder/)**: Simplifies UART configuration setup using the Builder Pattern.

#### Structural
- **[BT2_Facade](02__Design_Pattern/Structural/BT2_Facade/)**: Unifies control of subsystems in a smart home via a high-level Facade interface.

#### Behavioral
- **[BT1_Observer](02__Design_Pattern/Behavioral/BT1_Observer/)**: Implements an event notification system using the Observer Pattern for smart home sensors and devices.
- **[BT2_State_Machine](02__Design_Pattern/Behavioral/BT2_State_Machine/)**: Models a music player using the State Pattern to manage transitions between playing, paused, and stopped states.
